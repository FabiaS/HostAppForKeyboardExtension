# KeyboardExtensionHostApp

This app serves as a test environment for my custom keyboard extension (iOS).

The keyboard can have several horizontally scrollable pages showing several rows of buttons with letters or icons on them. 
Additionally there is a top bar with a switch-keyboard-button, a delete-button and a left / right button to scroll to the previous / next page.

NOTE: This is an exercise project to get used to doing auto layout programmatically and to actually write some Swift code :)
